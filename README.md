# MovieLibrary
FS mini project - Secondary Indexing

The project aims at developing autonomous and automatic system which keeps track of the genre that the user watches, the ratings he has given specific movies etc. The system then maps this and displays movies of the similar genre that the user watches. The system also has the ability to suggest movies based on what other users who engage with similar genre watch. These two algorithms help keep the entire movie library running without any external intervention while continuing to give quality recommendations to its users.
